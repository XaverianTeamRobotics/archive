# Welcome
Welcome to the Hawks Robotics FTC documentation! This site includes everything you need to get started and everything you need to learn how to use a piece of the codebase. If you're a beginner, head over to the onboarding section. If you're looking for docs on a piece of code, check out the reference dedicated to the branch the code is on or the branch you're using. If you need a Javadoc, you can access it the same way a regular doc, via the Javadocs section and a branch.
