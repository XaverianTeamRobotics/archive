TODO: ADD resetConfigForOpMode() IN ALL CONSTRUCTORS
TODO: determine which ids are for certain blinkin colors

TODO: refactor motors and encoders, i want an unencoded motor, an encoded motor, and an encoder
    - unencoded motor will only have voltage control - likely dc motor simple
    - encoded motor will have all control - basically a dc motor with a wrapper
    - encoder will have only encoder controls and our own reset - gives position, and when reset simply stores the current position and on all subsequent position queries subtract that value from the position
