The forever loop is the function called as long as the robot is running the teleOp

The initialize function is called once beforce the play button has been pressed on the controller 

The isButtonDown function is a gamepad button check I created so that I can choose buttons with a string *It can be removed and the isButtonDown references changed to gamepad references

The double servo1power controls the speed of the servo and which direction it is moving in so you can change the value that is already in the forever loop if you want to change the speed
